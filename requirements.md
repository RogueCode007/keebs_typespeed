# Type Speed MVP Requirements

## The following features must be a part of MVP for the project

1. Input field with text for user to type/complete
2. With each run, the user has a pre-determined amount of time to complete the pre-filled sentences. This pre-determined amount of time will be used to calculate typing speed
3. As a user types they should be graded on their typing speed and accuracy, based on the percent of word they type correctly and how quickly they complete each letter
4. Tool must have indicator for User's current position in paragraph
5. Tool must give indication for entry errors done by User
6. Tool should highlight each succcessful letter that is entered
7. Game should begin upon User action (i.e. start button)
   1. Before typing begins, display a countdown timer letting User know when the test starts
8. Text block that users will need to type can be hard-coded
9. Must have light/dark mode
10. A timer must display the current time left of the test. Upon reaching 0, the game ends and the User's score is revealed.

## Follow-up Tasks after MVP is complete

1. User can enter their email address to create an account and record their typing scores
2. User can select from multiple difficulties
   1. Difficulties will be determined by the following mechanisms: Duration of typing test & characters involved in test (e.g. inclusion of special characters)
3. Text blocks to be randomized and generated from chatGPT API
